            We are a family of Kosmic dreamers and doers  based in SWANA (South West Asia & North Africa) separated by borders and united in our commitment to co-creating a better future.
            <br><br>This year, we are partaking in this cool ensemble called the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.ttitd.io/index.php/Multicultural_POC_Neighborhood_at_Black_Rock_City">Multicultural Neighborhood</a>.

              We, the Kamels, are deeply connected to the work it will take to <b style="color:#d02ebf">build a radically different future</b>: where all people can live safely and freely in connection and exploration of their ancestral land, heritage, roots, and inner being and expression. We believe in shaking the oppressive borders and structures of the status quo.
              <br><br>Thus, the Kosmic Kamels have hoisted an interplanetary tent for people across borders to have good conversation, dream, play, and feel safe and nourished in the company of one another. Eye to eye and heart to heart. On the playa, <b style="color:#d02ebf">we honor our common heritage of hospitality</b>, welcoming the weary passersby into our tent with warm tea and dark coffee, shade, a good smoke, an engaging conversation... or by banging DJ set to shake off your defaults.
              <br><br>We take our fun very seriously. We believe the future we want to live in can only be visioned and co-created from spaces of love and joy. Play and creativity. Our <b style="color:#d02ebf">Kosmic Kommittment is to ‚Äúfunsciousness‚Äù</b>: prioritizing fun/joy while simultaneously building a community based on an awareness and action around our sometimes less fun realities. Funsciousess is conscious fun rooted in love, respect, and solidarity.
              <br><br>We do not shy away from difficult conversations and we invite visionary conversations that pave new ways forward. We are <b style="color:#d02ebf">committed to constantly learning and not ignoring the vast differences</b> of power, experience and access to equality across our region. We dream of a future that we could ALL get on a train and see the places we can‚Äôt. We want our camp and its people to start laying down the tracks‚Ä¶ From Cairo to catch a DJ in Beirut, by way of Sinai, Gaza, Jaffa and Haifa, then swing through Damascus and down to Amman. <b style="color:#d02ebf">Nobody‚Äôs free until everybody‚Äôs free</b> ‚úåÔ∏èüî•

                  <li>Stuff people forget to bring: Flashlights, personal lighting, goggles (for day and night), a dust mask, tools, a bike, a camping chair, warm night time clothes, a CamelBak, trashbags, sealable plastic bags, a plate, utensils, a cup, ID (must be 21 to drink; you can usually use a photocopy) You can also google ‚ÄúBurning Man Packing Lists‚Äù for helpful ideas</li>
                  <li>Think about all the stuff you use on a daily basis and make sure you have it</li>
                  <li>Burning Man is dangerous - quite literally - there are no permits, load testing, etc.  The platform you‚Äôre standing on could break.  Don‚Äôt be stupid.</li>
                  <li>Burning Man is hard and it will test you.  The difficulty is what preserves it.  Just roll with the punches, obstacles are new opportunities to meet people.</li>
                  <li>Examples: tent collapses, waiting in line 26 hours, your food went bad, generator breaks, mechanical issues with bike</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b style="color:#d02ebf">Immediacy</b> (‚ÄúJust Say Yes‚Äù)<br><b>What Is Immediacy/Why Is It So Important?</b>
              <br>Unlike the other principles of Burning Man, Immediacy may be one of the hardest to understand and actively implement, but is arguably one of the most important. Immediacy is better understood as the quality of your experience at Burning Man and one that should be consciously brought into your everyday life outside.
              <br>As people, we truly seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our innerselves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. Immediacy is allowing yourself to think and act freely and independent of anything but yourself in order to awaken from the complication of your life and truly understand yourself in the rawest form.
              <br>Examples - thought runs through your head to climb that installation - DO IT, ever think ‚Äúwe should get on that art car?‚Äù - DON'T THINK JUST DO IT - see where the playa takes you

              <li><b style="color:#d02ebf">Radical Self-Expression</b><br><b>What Is Radical Self-Expression/Why Is It Important?</b>
                  <img src="images/radicalexpression.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="170px" />
                  <ul>
                      <li>Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of you as an individual. No one other than you or a group you opt into can determine its content. It‚Äôs yours. Be proud. Express yourself in colors, in fabrics, in nothing, in a message, whatever you want, use your body as a canvas and express yourself how you want to. This is your first gift to the playa.</li>
                      <li>DON‚ÄôT BE SCARED TO BE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU ARE THAT DAY</li>
                  </ul>
                  <b><u>BE MINDFUL OF MOOP - i.e. feathers, sequins, leather, anything that sheds, things that fall off easily, etc.</u></b>
              </li>
              <li><b style="color:#d02ebf">Leave No Trace</b>
              <ul>
                  <li>Why<ul>
                      <li>Leave No Trace means it is our responsibility to leave Burning Man cleaner than we found it</li>
                      <img src="images/moopmap.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="170px" />
                      <li>You will not see any trash, cups, glass, paper, etc on the ground at BM - you can walk around barefoot</li>
                      <li>At the end of BM, organizers do a full sweep of the playa and mark trash down to the nearest foot</li>
                      <li>Camps that are not ‚Äògreen‚Äô lose placement preferences the next year</li>
                      <li>If the state of Nevada finds trash, BM can be banned in future years</li>
                      <li>Trash is called MOOP - Matter Out Of Place</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>How<ul>
                      <li>MOOP is your individual responsibility - BM does not provide trash cans</li>
                      <li>‚ÄòKeep It From Hitting the Ground‚Äô - When you go out, bring a small reusable bag to store your trash (beer cans, wrappers, etc)</li>
                      <li>‚ÄòClean As We Go‚Äô - Pick up any trash you see, <u>even if it‚Äôs not yours</u>, even if it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs camp.  Someone will have to pick it up, so just do it. Keep sealable plastic bags in your backpack to hold it</li>
                      <img src="images/moophow.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="170px" />
                      <li>BEFORE you leave home - unwrap, unpack all your stuff. (Eg take your new CamelBak out of it‚Äôs box and remove all packaging before you leave)</li>
                      <li>Pack It Out - when you leave BM, make sure you are taking trash bags with you in your car.  The camp truck is reserved for bulky items, not trash</li>
                      <li>Final sweep - Before you leave, do an inch by inch sweep of your area and the camp in general.  Everyone should do their part</li>
                      <li>Bring 1-2 trashbags for your own tent</li>
                      <li>Don‚Äôt bring feathers, confetti, sequins, shaggy carpets, or anything that may shed</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li>What<br>MOOP at BM is different than trash at home.  These things are MOOP:<ul>
                      <li>Hair</li>
                      <li>Crumbs from nachos</li>

                  <li>BM is on Federal land in the state of Nevada.  Laws apply.  There are undercover police - some are naked.  Police use night vision</li>

                  <li>Black Rock Rangers are provided by BM.  They are like coaches, trying to prevent issues before they happen</li>

                  <li><b>No transactions, advertising, branding, or sponsorships</b>. Since you‚Äôve adhered to the principle of radical self-reliance, you‚Äôre good to go! Don‚Äôt buy, sell or advertise things - stick to gifting</li>
